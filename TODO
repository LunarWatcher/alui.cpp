## Known bugs

* Hyphens overflow containers, because hyphen widths are ignored

## Planned features

* [ ] word break first, character break as a last resort (configurable)
* [ ] 9patch support for elements
    * I never understood the point with 9patches before, and I now do. They're actually pretty neat
